The “class” syntax
The basic syntax is:

class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}

//eg.
 new MyClass() to create a new object with all the listed methods.

The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

For example:

class User {

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }

}

// Usage:
let user = new User("John");
user.sayHi();
When new User("John") is called:

A new object is created.
The constructor runs with the given argument and assigns it to this.name.
…Then we can call object methods, such as user.sayHi().
